# Architecture

## Overview

GameHub is a modern full-stack application built using ASP.NET Core and React.

The backend follows the principles of Clean Architecture while organizing features using Vertical Slice Architecture. The application is implemented as a **Modular Monolith**, providing clear boundaries between modules while remaining simple to develop, test, and deploy.

The architecture prioritizes maintainability, readability, scalability, and testability over unnecessary complexity. Dependencies always point inward, keeping the business domain independent from frameworks and infrastructure.

# Architectural Principles

GameHub follows these principles:

- Clean Architecture
- SOLID Principles
- Separation of Concerns
- Dependency Injection
- Vertical Slice Architecture
- Domain-Driven Design (lightweight)
- Feature-first organization
- Test-Driven mindset where appropriate

# Project Structure

# Domain Structure

```
GameHub.Domain

├── Common

Models will contain our core business concepts.

# Layer Responsibilities

## GameHub.API

Responsible for:

- Controllers
- Authentication configuration
- Authorization
- Middleware
- Dependency Injection
- Swagger
- API Versioning

The API should contain no business logic.

---

## GameHub.Application

Responsible for:

- Business workflows
- Commands
- Queries
- DTOs
- Interfaces
- Validation
- Application Services

Features are organized vertically.

Example:

```
Games/

Commands/

Queries/

DTOs/

Validators/
```

---

## GameHub.Domain

Responsible for:

- Business Models
- Enums
- Value Objects
- Domain Events
- Business Rules

The Domain layer has **no dependency** on ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework, PostgreSQL, or any external framework.  [oai_citation:1‡Clean Architecture](https://cleanarchitecture.jasontaylor.dev/docs/architecture/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

---

## GameHub.Infrastructure

Responsible for:

- Entity Framework Core
- PostgreSQL
- Repository implementations
- Authentication
- Logging
- File Storage
- External APIs
- Email

Infrastructure implements the abstractions defined by the Application layer.

---

# Dependency Rule

Dependencies always point inward.

```
Infrastructure
      │
      ▼
Application
      │
      ▼
Domain
```

The Domain layer never depends on any outer layer.

---

# Pagination

List endpoints never return an unbounded result set — they return a bounded page
wrapped in a `PagedResponse<T>` envelope (`items`, `page`, `pageSize`,
`totalCount`, `totalPages`).

**Chosen strategy: offset pagination** (`?page=&pageSize=`).

**Why:** the current list endpoints (starting with `GET /api/users`) are
admin/moderation screens, where users expect page numbers, a total count, and the
ability to jump to any page — offset's strengths. Its weaknesses (slow deep
offsets, drift under concurrent writes) do not matter at admin-scale data.
Keyset/cursor pagination is reserved for a later, genuinely different access
pattern (e.g. a public infinite-scroll feed).

Paging input is clamped in the handler (`page >= 1`, `pageSize` in `[1, 100]`,
default `20`) so a client cannot request an unbounded page.

See `08-pagination.md` for the full offset-vs-keyset comparison and rationale.

---

# Authentication

Authentication is **stateless, JWT-based**. `POST /api/auth/login` verifies
credentials (bcrypt) and issues a signed access token; the client sends it as
`Authorization: Bearer <token>` and the server trusts it by verifying the
signature — no session store, no per-request database lookup.

The layering follows the same Ports & Adapters rule as the rest of the app:

- **Application** owns the *what*: the `IJwtTokenGenerator` port (twin of
  `IPasswordHasher`), the `Login` slice, and `AuthErrors.InvalidCredentials`.
  It knows nothing about the JWT library.
- **Infrastructure** owns the *how*: `JwtTokenGenerator` (the only file that
  touches the JWT library) and `JwtSettings` (typed `Jwt` config).
- **API** owns the *wiring*: `AuthController` plus the JwtBearer middleware in
  `Program.cs` that validates incoming tokens and sets `HttpContext.User`
  (`UseAuthentication()` before `UseAuthorization()`).

Key decisions: a **vague 401** on any credential failure (no user enumeration),
and **role carried in the token** as a login-time snapshot (fast, stateless
authorization) with a short token lifetime to bound staleness. A refresh-token
flow is a planned future slice.

See `10-authentication-jwt.md` for the full JWT model and decisions, and
`11-secrets-and-configuration.md` for the signing secret.

# Application Messaging (in-house mediator)

Controllers do not call handlers directly. They inject one dispatcher, `ISender`,
and send a command or query; the mediator resolves the matching handler and runs
the request through a **pipeline of behaviors** first. This decouples controllers
from handlers and gives cross-cutting concerns (currently validation, via
`ValidationBehavior`) a single home instead of duplicated code in every handler.

It is a hand-built ~100-line equivalent of MediatR / `@nestjs/cqrs` (MediatR is now
paid). Handlers are auto-registered by assembly scan, so a new slice is just a
command/query + a handler — no DI wiring. See `12-mediator.md` for the full design.

Endpoints are **secure by default**: `[Authorize]` on the `ApiController` base
requires a token everywhere; `[AllowAnonymous]` opts specific endpoints out (login,
public registration), and `[Authorize(Roles = "Admin")]` narrows the
admin/moderation surface (user management).

# Technology Stack

## Backend

- .NET 10
- ASP.NET Core
- Entity Framework Core
- PostgreSQL
- JWT Authentication
- FluentValidation
- Serilog
- xUnit

---

## Frontend

- React + TypeScript
- Vite (build & dev server)
- TanStack Router (type-safe routing)
- TanStack Query (server state / data fetching)
- TanStack Table (headless data tables)
- shadcn/ui (components on Radix + Tailwind; form-agnostic `Field` primitives)
- Tailwind CSS (styling)
- TanStack Form + Zod (forms & client-side validation via Standard Schema)

### Rendering: client-rendered SPA (no SSR, for now)

The frontend is a **client-rendered single-page app** that consumes the .NET API.
We are **not** using TanStack Start (SSR/full-stack) at this stage.

**Why:** the backend is ASP.NET Core, so TanStack Start's main value — server
functions / full-stack — is already provided by the API. Adopting Start now would
add a second server runtime and an SSR pipeline mainly to gain SSR, whose payoffs
(SEO, fast first paint) matter only for the future *public* storefront, which is
several phases away. TanStack Router as a standalone SPA gives the same type-safe
routing without that complexity.

**Future trigger:** when the public, SEO-relevant storefront becomes a real goal,
migrate to TanStack Start (it is built on TanStack Router, so this is an upgrade
path rather than a rewrite).

### Forms: TanStack Form (not React Hook Form)

**Why:** the frontend is already on TanStack Router, Query, and Table, so
TanStack Form keeps the stack a single cohesive family (one mental model, shared
devtools) and offers stronger TypeScript inference — consistent with the
type-safety goal that runs through the whole project. Since October 2025,
shadcn/ui's `Field` component is form-library-agnostic and officially supports
TanStack Form, removing the historical reason to default to React Hook Form.
Zod remains the schema validator (via Standard Schema).

- Docker Compose
- GitHub Actions

# Planned Design Patterns

| Pattern | Planned Usage |
|----------|---------------|
| Repository | Data access |
| Factory | Notification creation |
| Strategy | Discount calculations |
| Observer | Notifications & Achievements |
| Builder | Complex Game creation |
| Adapter | External game integrations |
| Decorator | Logging & Caching |
| Dependency Injection | Service composition |

Patterns will only be introduced when they solve a real problem.

# User Model

Every authenticated person is represented by a **User**.

A User can optionally create a **DeveloperProfile**.

Creating a DeveloperProfile grants publishing capabilities while the user still retains all normal user functionality.

```
User
 │
 ├── Library
 ├── Wishlist
 ├── Friends
 ├── Reviews
 └── DeveloperProfile (optional)
           │
           └── Games
```

This models the business domain more accurately than using inheritance or a dedicated Developer role.

---

# User Types

## User

Every authenticated account is a User.

Users can:

- Purchase games
- Maintain a library
- Create reviews
- Add friends
- Unlock achievements
- Maintain a wishlist

Users may optionally create a Developer Profile.

---

## Developer Profile

A Developer Profile extends a User's capabilities.

It contains:

- Display Name
- Biography

---

## Administrator

Administrators have elevated permissions.

Administrators can:

- Approve or reject games
- Moderate reviews
- Manage users
- Manage discounts

---

# Planned Domain Model
